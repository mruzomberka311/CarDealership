# Project Title

## Description of the Project

This project is meant to simulate an interface for a car dealership. By connecting classes, we can filter through an inventory of vehicles by 
their different attributes. Adding and removing vehicles from the inventory can also be done, but each change is updated to the corresponding excel file. 
The inventory is meant to be filtered and updated in real time just like a real one accept the scale on this one is smaller.
